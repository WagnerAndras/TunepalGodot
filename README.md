# Tunepal

Tunepal is an app for finding the names of Tunes and organizing Tunes for learning purposes. It was developed by Bryan Duggan and others. 

This goal of this project is to create a new, modern Tunepal that solves a number of problems with the original, while providing a platform for future development and research.

The plan is to rebuild Tunepal from the ground up using Godot for its cross platform capabilities and and support for extensions in different languages.
