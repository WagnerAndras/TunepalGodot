# Tunepal

Tunepal is an app for finding the names of Tunes and organizing Tunes for learning purposes. It was developed by Bryan Duggan and others. 

This goal of this project is to create a new, modern Tunepal that solves a number of problems with the original, while providing a platform for future development and research.

The plan is to rebuild Tunepal from the ground up using Godot for its cross platform capabilities and and support for extensions in different languages.

The new Tunepal:

- One project for all platforms: Android, IOS and Web
- Support for different screen sizes including tablets
- Fast, off-line searches, running on device
- Better accuracy
- Updated corpus with the latest available transcriptions to ABC of the classic sources.
- Interactive music scores with playback, repeat sections and slowdown
- Support for full range of instruments, sessions and recordings
- Import new sources
- Europeana sounds integration - connection to the Comhaltas archive, ITMA and others
- Backup Tunebooks in the cloud and share across devices
- Share Tunes and sets with other users
- Integration with thesession.org
- Platform for future research and development
- Free and open-source forever
